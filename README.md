# SCASA: Shape Complementarity and Surface Area

## What is Shape Complementarity?

Shape Complementarity (SC) 

## What is (buried or available) surface area?
 BSA is a geometric quantity that measures to total surface area (in
Ã…<sup>2</sup>) of a complex buried within another complex. ASA is the reciprocal; 
 that is, the total surface area accesible. This calculation of accessibility is generally calcualted in relation
to solvent acessible surface area (SASA). SASA imagines that a ball of a given radius is rolling along the surface ofthe protein of interest.
If there is sufficient geometric space to allow the solvent to pass unimpeded it said to be accessible.
