# SCASA: Shape Complementarity and Surface Area

## What is Shape Complementarity?

Shape Complementarity (SC) 

## What is (buried or available) surface area?
 BSA is a geometric quantity that measures to total surface area (in
Ã…<sup>2</sup>) of a complex buried within another complex. ASA is the reciprocal; 
 that is, the total surface area accesible. This calculation of accessibility is generally calcualted in relation
to solvent acessible surface area (SASA). SASA imagines that a ball of a given radius is rolling along the surface ofthe protein of interest.
If there is sufficient geometric space to allow the solvent to pass unimpeded it said to be accessible.

This tool calculates ASA by using the Shrake Ruplley algorithm implemented in Biopython. It then computes BSA
by calculating the ASA of the complex of interest unbound to the other complexes in the structure and comparing the two numbers.

## What is the scope of this tool?
This tools is designed to be used as both a standalone tool and a module to be imported.
